# TurtleBot3 Camera-Based Line Follower with Static Obstacle Avoidance

This ROS 2 Humble workspace implements autonomous line following combined with a finite state machine (FSM) safety controller for static obstacle avoidance on a TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi. The system uses a visual PID loop for line tracking, Lidar scan sectors for obstacle detours, and a control multiplexer for seamless transitions.

## System Topology & Data Flow

    Camera[/camera/image_raw/] --> Detector[line_detector]
    Detector -->|line_error| Controller[line_controller]
    Controller -->|cmd_vel_raw| Mux[cmd_vel_mux]

```

1. **Line Detection**: The `line_detector` node processes `/camera/image_raw` using OpenCV (HSV thresholding, morphological filtering, and contour selection) to compute the centroid deviation from the center of the frame (`/line_error`).
2. **Line Control**: The `line_controller` node uses a PID controller (proportional steering with velocity slowdown at sharp curves) to publish raw control inputs (`/cmd_vel_raw`).
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The `obstacle_avoid` node processes `/scan` Lidar data. When an obstacle is detected in the front sector, it publishes to `/safety_state` and executes a multi-phase bypass trajectory (Turn Away, Shift Out, Drive Past, and Rejoin).
4. **Command Mux**: The `cmd_vel_mux` node arbitrates control between `/cmd_vel_raw` and `/cmd_vel_obstacle` based on the active `/safety_state`, publishing the output to `/cmd_vel` with zero handover latency.

## Installation & Build

### Dependencies
- ROS 2 Humble
- Gazebo 11
- OpenCV 4
- `cv_bridge`
- TurtleBot3 simulation packages (included in `src/`)

### Compilation
From the workspace root, compile the packages:
```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```
Source the environment:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## Execution Guide

### 1. Launch the Simulation and Autonomy Stack
Execute the unified orchestration script. This starts the Gazebo environment, spawns the robot, launches the line follower and obstacle avoidance nodes, and opens RViz:
```bash
./run_final_demo.sh
```

### 2. Monitoring & Debugging
Tail node logs in real time:
```bash
tail -f logs/autonomy_line.log
tail -f logs/safety_obstacle.log
tail -f logs/cmd_vel_mux.log
```
Check control messages:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /line_error
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel
```

### 3. Graceful Shutdown
Shut down all processes, including simulator instances, RViz, and background nodes:
```bash
./stop_final_demo.sh
```
